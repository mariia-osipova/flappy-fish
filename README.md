## Flappy Fish — Practical Assignment

### Objective

The goal of this project is to build a pygame-based game inspired by Flappy Bird, where the player controls a fish avoiding randomly generated pipes. In addition to the standard gameplay, the project integrates a simple machine-learning component: an autonomous agent trained using a genetic algorithm

The GA optimizes the parameters of a quadratic decision policy, allowing the agent to learn when to flap based on the game state variables (dy, dx, vy).
Over many generations, the population evolves toward more effective behavior, gradually improving survival time and the number of pipes successfully passed.
